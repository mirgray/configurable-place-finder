                <!-- This rule provides OAuth 2 authentication for an arcgis.com app. This authentication is
                     a two-step process: the rule asks arcgis.com for a token using credentials defined below,
                     then the proxy is able to use this token to access AGOL content. The proxy caches the
                     token for the period specified below.
                     To generate application-level authentication credentials, go to arcgis.com and create
                     a new application item ("The item is: An application" + ● Web Mapping) and provide your
                     site's URL. On the new item's arcgis.com page under the App Registration section, click
                     on REGISTER and use the Add button to add your site's URL into the "Redirect URI" list;
                     leave the app type as "Browser". Click REGISTER. The App Registration section will be
                     updated with the item's App ID; click on Show Secret to see the App Secret; copy both
                     to the credentials (below). -->
